= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This even means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Numbers don't lie =
Optimizing SEO is a fundamental process for any website. So we try to be non-intrusive with The SEO Framework.
The SEO Framework is byte and process optimized on PHP level, with each update the optimization is improved when possible.

* This plugin is written with massive and busy (multi-)sites in mind.
* This plugin is 125% to 184% faster compared to other popular SEO plugins.
* This plugin consumes 161% more server resources than other popular SEO plugins in exchange for rendering performance. // var_dump retest this value.
* This plugin has 130% to 160% more database interactions in exchange for rendering performance.
* And last but not least, this plugin has 100% fewer advertisements. Let's keep it that way.

*Numbers may vary per installation and version.*

= Completely pluggable =
The SEO Framework also features pluggable functions. All functions are active and can be called within the WordPress Loop.
This allows other developers to extend the plugin wherever needed.
We have also provided an API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= Caching =

This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

**If you use object caching:**
The output will be stored for each page, if you've edited a page the page output Meta will stay the same until the object cache expires. So be sure to clear your object cache or wait until it expires.

**Supported Caches:**

* Server-level Opcode (optimized).
* Staticvar functions (prevents running code twice or more).
* Staticvar class (instead of globals, prevents constructors running multiple times).
* Objects for database calls.
* Transients for process intensive operations or persisting communication with front-and back end.
* CDN for Open Graph and Twitter images.
* HTML and script Minification caching as well as Database caching are also supported.

= Compatibility =

**Basics:**

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) support.
* Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen-reader accessibility.
* Admin screen: Posts, Pages, Taxonomies, Terms, Custom Post Types.
* Front-end: Every page, post, taxonomy, term, custom post type, search request, 404, etc.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title "doing it right" (or wrong).

**Plugins:**

* W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, Batcache, etc.
* WooCommerce: Shop Page, Products, Product Breadcrumbs, Product Galleries, Product Categories and Product Tags.
* Custom Post Types, (all kinds of plugins) with automatic integration.
* WPMUdev and Donncha's Domain Mapping with full HTTPS support.
* WPMUdev Avatars for og:image and twitter:image if no other image is found.
* bbPress: Forums, Topics, Replies.
* BuddyPress profiles.
* Ultimate Member profiles.
* AnsPress Questions, Profiles and Pages, also Canonical errors have been fixed.
* StudioPress SEO Data Transporter for Posts and Pages.
* WPML, URLs, sitemap and per-page/post SEO settings. (The full and automated compatibility is being discussed with WPML.)
* qTranslate X, URLs, limited sitemap and per-page/post SEO settings (through shortcodes by set by qTranslate X).
* Jetpack modules: Custom Content Types (Testimonials, Portfolio), Infinite Scroll, Photon.
* Most popular SEO plugins, let's not get in each other's way.
* Many, many other plugins, yet to confirm.

**Themes:**

* All themes.
* Special extended support for Genesis & Genesis SEO. This plugin takes all Post, Page, Category and Tag SEO values from Genesis and uses them within The SEO Framework Options. The easiest upgrade!

If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.
It will however output robots metadata, LD+Json and og:image, among various other meta data which are bound to social media.

= Transferring SEO data using SEO Data Transporter =

Because this plugin was initially written to extend the Genesis SEO, it uses the same option name values. This makes transferring from Genesis SEO to The SEO Framework work automatically.

> If you didn't use Genesis SEO previously, Nathan Rice (StudioPress) has created an awesome plugin for your needs to transfer your SEO data.
>
> Get the [SEO Data Transporter from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-data-transporter/).
>
> Usage:<br>
> 1. Install and activate SEO Data Transporter.<br>
> 2. Go to the <strong>SEO Data Transporter menu within Tools</strong>.<br>
> 3. Select your <strong>previous SEO plugin</strong> within the first dropdown menu.<br>
> 4. Select <strong>Genesis</strong> within the second dropdown menu.<br>
> 5. Click <strong>Analyze</strong> for extra information about the data transport.<br>
> 6. Click <strong>Convert</strong> to convert the data.
>
> The SEO Framework now uses the same data from the new Genesis SEO settings on Posts, Pages and Taxonomies.

= About the sitemap =

The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the sitemap of this plugin.

= Other notes =

*Genesis SEO will be disabled upon activating this plugin. This plugin takes over and extends Genesis SEO.*

***The Automatic Description Generation will work with any installation, but it will exclude shortcodes. This means that if you use shortcodes or a page builder, be sure to enter your custom description or the description will fall short.***

***The home page tagline settings won't have any effect on the title output if your theme's title output is not written according to the WordPress standards, which luckily are enforced strongly on new WordPress.org themes since recently.***

> <strong>Check out the "[Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/#Other-Notes)" tab for the API documentation.</strong>

*I'm aware that radio buttons lose their input when you drag the metaboxes around. This issue is fixed since WordPress 4.5.0 (alpha and later).*
*But not to worry: Your previous setting will be returned on save. So it's like nothing happened.*

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!

1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 70 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer, how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I'm not a developer, how can I help? =

A way of donating is available through the donation link on the plugin website.
However, you can also greatly help by telling your friends about this plugin :).

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= No ads! Why? =

Nope, no ads! No nags! No links! Never!
Why? Because I hate them, probably more than you do.
I also don't want to taint your website from the inside, like many popular plugins do.
Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

***But how do you make a living?***

Currently, The SEO Framework is non-profit.
This plugin was first released to the public in March 15th, 2015. From there it has grown, from 179 lines of code, to more than 17100 lines.
With over 600,000 characters of code written, this plugin is absolutely a piece of art in my mind.
And that's what it should stay, (functional) art.
I trust that people are good at heart and will tell their friends and family about the things they enjoy the most, what they're excited about, what they find beneficial or even beautiful.

With The SEO Framework I try to achieve exactly that. It's made with <3.

= Does this plugin collect my data? =

Absolutely not! Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

= Premium version? =

Nope! Only premium extensions. These are planned and being developed.

= If a premium extensions is released, what will happen to this plugin? =

This plugin is built to be an all-in-one SEO solution for professional environments, so:

1. No advertisements about the premium extensions will be placed within this plugin.
1. No features will be removed or replaced for premium-only features.
1. The premium extensions will most likely only be used for big-business SEO. Which are very difficult to develop and which will confuse most users anyway.

= I've heard about an extension manager, what's that? =

Currently it's not available. When it is, it will allow you to download and activate extensions for The SEO Framework. It will support both multisite and single-site and the registration will be based on the Akismet plugin.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not a problem. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's useability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The (home page) title is different from the og:title, or doesn't do what I want or told it to. =

The theme you're using is using outdated standards and is therefore doing it wrong. Inform your theme author about this issue.

Give the theme author these two links: https://codex.wordpress.org/Title_Tag https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/25/title-tag-support-now-required/

If you know your way around PHP, you can speed up this process by replacing the `<title>some code here</title>` code with `<title><?php wp_title('') ?></title>` within the `header.php` file of the theme you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.
If you're using W3 Total Cache you might be interested in [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3tc-auto-pilot/) to do it for you.

= Ugh, I don't want anyone to know I'm using The SEO Framework! =

Aww :(
Oh well, here's the filter you need to remove the HTML tags saying where the Meta tags are coming from:
`add_filter( 'the_seo_framework_indicator', '__return_false' );`

= I'm fine with The SEO Framework, but not with you! =

Well then! D: We got off on the wrong foot, I guess..
If you wish to remove only my name from your HTML code, here's the filter:
`add_filter( 'sybre_waaijer_<3', '__return_false' );`

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.6.0 - Pragmatic Foundation =

**Release date:**
/
* May TODO 2016

**Preamble:**

* This is a dot version bump update, which is done so as the core code has been changed drastically. **Thirteen new classes** have been added to maintain structured code, including many more function to fetch data easily and consitently.
* With hundreds of changes, I had to find a new way to present this update in an understandable manner. So here goes!

**Summarized:**
/
* With over 200 (TODO) notable changes, I bring you a new Pragmatic Foundation.
* Most importantly, this update allows you to be better informed about your website's index status, through the much improved SEO bar.
* As the issue of the incorrect title length has finally been found, this update glorifies its plugin's **title counter** once more.
* Many new options have been included within the SEO Settings page. Including much desired Title and Description options.
* Also, many **linguistic improvements** have been put in place on many places.
* **WPML compatibility** has received a rework, now all canonical URLs in the sitemap and front-end are always correct. The **qTranslate X** settings are now also being taken into account when outputting canonical URLs.
* A new script has been added on the front-page. This will make sure the Breadcrumb homepage name will be correct in the Search Engine Results Page.
* The breadcrumb script has been expanded to work on posts with multiple and nested categories. These scripts now also work on WooCommerce products. Don't be surprised if you suddenly have all kinds of scripts in the header! These scripts help Google and other Search Engines better understand your website.
* And for developers, with the code expanding rapidly, this update brings new light to the code by **reorganizing the code into dedicated classes** and is including many major refactorizations.

**Feature highlights:**
/
* WooCommerce schema.org breadcrumbs.

**Feature highlights visualized:**
/
* TODO View side-by-side visual changes [here](link_to_page)

**No Stone Left Unturned:**

* This massive update has touched almost every aspect of this plugin.
* With this, many fixes are put into effect for all known and possibly many unknown bugs. Better standards have been put into place, both for WordPress and the coding world.
* All changes have been tested thorougly. However, it's always possible something has been overlooked. If you find anything out of place, let me know in the [plugin support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription)!

**SEO Tip of the Update: Redirects & Canonical**
/
* A change in the Canonical URL or the use of a 301 Redirect URL indicate that your page has moved.
* These can be seen by Search Engines as the same. However, the 301 Redirect enforces the relocation of the page to everyone, whereas the Canonical URL softly indicates.
* When changing the Canonical URL of a Page, you're telling robots to look and elsewhere, be sure to include a link to the new Page on the canonicalized Page to indicate where everything has moved to.
* However, it's even better to enforce a 301 redirect. This makes sure both your visitors as Search Engines know where to be instantaneously.
* If you've changed the permalink of a popular post, you should create an empty post that follows one of the said examples.

**Anouncements:**

* When I started developing this update, I announced a new extension plugin for The SEO Framework! [Title Fix - The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-title-fix/).
* This update ensures extra compatiblity with the Title Fix plugin, this will add back removed title features for if the theme is doing it wrong and when the Title Fix plugin is active.

**About: Plugin progression and help wanted:**

* This dear project has taken me over 2500 hours to perfectionize and maintain. This update alone has cost me over 220 hours to complete.
* I really want to keep this project free. In fact, Author SEO was actually planned to be a premium extension.
* I also want to turn this project into my full-time job, even if it's free from monetization and/or premium content.
* And I will keep my promises, always: This plugin will stay free of ads, (self-)reference and this plugin will continue to be maintained.
* All with all, this means I can't do it without your help!
* Please consider making a donation. The link can be found on the WordPress.org plugin page. Or [here](https://theseoframework.com/?p=572).
* Thank you so much for your support!

**About: Changes in Changelog**

* I love to push many changes at once every update, as I'm only happy when everything works. If I find a bug, I'll be sure to fix it!
* So to clean up the massive changelogs, detailed information on updates are put aside and are visible on the plugin's website.
* With each update, I try to find better ways of presenting information and I try to minimize confusion.
* Putting everything in categorized lists is one way of presenting information, to erase sentence flow and to prevent misunderstanding.

**For translators:**

* Please look for **Front-end output** comments within the translation page to find high-priority translations.

**For everyone - Square SEO Bar:**
/
* From now on, the SEO bar is flat and square. This gives a more modern look and feel.

**For everyone - Option Merging:**
/
* From this plugin update, new default options are automatically merged with the previous options.
* This way, you don't have to update each site you own with the new recommended features.
* No options will be overwritten in this process, and it only happens in the admin area.
* This new feature is multisite compatible and can be disabled through a filter.
* An update notification will shown whenever this happens, only to the Super Admin on Mutli-Site environments, and only to Admins on Single-Site environments.
* The notification is unbranded, it will say "New SEO options have been updated." on the SEO Settings Page and will add "View the new options here." on all other Admin Pages.

**For everyone - About Schema Markup:**
/
* New schema markup has been added, this helps Search Engines better understand your website.
* Breadcrumbs have been expanded, to support nested categories and multiple categories. Now you can see multiple breadcrumb scripts to help Search Engines better understand your website's structure.
* Breadcrumbs scripts now also work on WooCommerce products, enjoy!

**For everyone - About translations:**
/
* Objective translations for grammatically gender noun types like "this post" (male in Dutch) and "this page" (genderless in Dutch) within sentences which are fetched dynamically (like "Product" and "ProductTag" for WooCommerce) couldn't be translated correctly.
* Therefore, I've exchanged these types of sentences without losing understanding of those.
* Small changes within translations happen over time and I try to reduce it when to only when nessecary, as this is an ongoing project you can expect continous improvements wherever possible. Translating WordPress and its plugins are a team effort :).
* Other small changes include conversion of WordPress slang to real English. Like "Paged" to "Paginated".
* Over time, inconsitencies have been created with the language used within this plugin. If you still find any, please notify me through the support forums and I'll address them.
* Thanks @pidengmor for many (over 30) linguistic improvements, they're really appreciated! Thank you so much for your time!
* I also want to make a big shout out to all the other translators who have contributed to this plugin! <3

**For developers - About class changes:**
/
* This plugin should always be extended with the use of filters, actions or with the use of the Settings API.
* This plugin relies on a God class, which has been put into a cached function `the_seo_framework()`.
* Interacting with the class functions statically could lead to duplicated constructor output and fatal errors.
* Therefore it's always implied and recommended to use `the_seo_framework()` function if you need to interact with any of the functions.
* If done correctly, whichever update comes in the future won't break the site(s).

**For developers - About the new functions:**
/
* In order to maintain a stable future, most dynamic generation output that depends on a setting are put in functions.
* This also counts for filters. To prevent and fix miscalculations through Javascript and other means.

**For developers - Performance, improved:**
/
* I've tested out some yet undiscovered ground on PHP while doing millions of iterations in the benchmark.
* These benchmarks can be found in the aptly named `benchmark.php` file.
* What I found is that an if-statement looks passes if the value is a boolean. So converting any value to a boolean will improve its speed.
* I also found that strict false checks are faster than using an exclamation mark. E.g. `false === $thing` is faster than `! $thing`, as the latter flips the boolean, which requires extra processing power.
* These methodologic improvements have put into effect throughout the whole plugin, with this you will notice an extremely minor performance improvement. But every little bit matters in a framework.
* Because this plugin has grown massively in size with this update, the memory use has been increased negligibly. However, in a future update I will see if this can be improved upon.
* The netto outcome of this plugin's performance with this update is about 0%, this is because many more items are being rendered, even though overall performance has been improved.

**For developers - Refactoring classes:**

* The classes `AutoDescription_DoingItRight`, `AutoDescription_Generate_Description`, `AutoDescription_Generate_Url`, `AutoDescription_Generate_Ldjson`, and `AutoDescription_Generate_Title` have been greatly refactored to improve performance and maintainability.
* All pre-overhaul functions have maintained their initial behaviour, the generation of the output has just been split over multiple functions.

**For developers - About WP Query Sync:**

* The current WordPress query only works on the front-end.
* `query.class.php` contains alternative functions based on the WordPress query.
* These functions work just like WordPress Core query functions, but now they also look for the screens in the admin area.
* These functions do not work on custom post types, yet. But they do work on WooCommerce products and product categories.
* This resulted in easing the whole code base as it doesn't have to check for admin/front-end per-function anymore. Further improvements are planned, but this update already contains most of the overhaul.

**Looking forward - Upcoming features:**

Not all planned features made it into 2.6.0.

* WP.me shortlink integration.
* Article modified time output can now be adjusted, just like the sitemap timing options.
* Per page title additions options (reverse of Global Settings).
* The SEO Bar options.
* Canonical SEO (URL scheme options).
* Twitter card plugin detection and subtle notification of such.
* Image Description is now used as an excerpt for the attachment's page meta descriptions.
* Author SEO (Title, Description, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.).
* Jetpack Sitemap detection.

**Detailed log:**

***There are a lot more changes in this update which did not make it to this page. Please refer to [the detailed changelog](https://theseoframework.com/?p=xxx).***

**Many, many other - both minor and major - changes did not make it to the detailed log. For example, when a new function has been added to check for a state, the use of it goes throughout the plugin, effectively added many changes.**

*What do you think of this change? Let me know at [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/) (no support questions there, please)!*

	* Non-executive `index.php` files in folders which contain readable files, to prevent indexing of such.
	* WooCommerce breadcrumb support!
	* Nested post categories now also have a breadcrumb script. Multiple even, when applicable.

	* Reduced the chance of WPMUdev Domain Mapping's Async CDSSO Script being incorrect due to unorthodox rewrite flushing.
* **Fixed:**

	* WPML URL base structure check was done wrongfully, the canonical URLs are now fixed for multilingual pages.

	* Incorrect description was output on some archives.
	* The removal of title additions now correctly reflect on the title counter length when JavaScript is disabled.

	* When using subsets of languages, e.g. "nl-NL-formal", the check no longer falls back to "en_US", but to "nl_NL". This affects `og:locale` in particular.
	* Robots.txt subdirectory admin path is now rendered correctly.
* **Removed:**
	* Shortlink URL from Home Page, as it's quite useless and self referring there.
	* Yahoo Pinging option and initiation, as they've moved to Bing quite some time ago (oops).
	* WPMUdev Avatars support. As WordPress core has taken over this feature and it was unreliable.
	* Canonical URL from Search and 404 pages. It yields no value on those pages and might even yield incorrect results.
	* Official support for WordPress 3.6 and 3.7. It takes too much time to maintain such backwards compatibility.
* **Note:**
	* This version is yet incompatible with the upcoming Genesis 2.3.0 update. This means that this plugin can no longer automatically merge its data with previously set Genesis Terms data. This issue should be resolved in an upcoming update, which I hope to have released before Genesis 2.3.0.

	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::get_all_options()` function.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Url::get_relative_term_url()` second parameter `(array) $args` replaces `(bool) $no_request`.

	* `AutoDescription_Core::post_type_support()` now has an array argument parameter.
	* `AutoDescription_Core::get_the_real_ID()` now returns 0 instead of false if no ID is found.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::build_title_notagline()` is now protected.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title_for_terms()` now uses `array $args` for parameters.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::generate_title()` now uses `array $args` for parameters.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()` admin functions now don't rely on `$args['meta']` anymore to bypass doing it wrong detection, but rather on `is_admin()` checks.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()`'s `$args['meta']` is now set to default `false`.
	* CSS and JS file identifiers have their duplicated `css` or `js` removed. So `autodescription-css-css` is now `autodescription-css`, and so forth.
* **Updated:**
	* JS files and cache.
	* CSS files and cache.

	* The metabox navigation tabs' content is now also automatically aligned.
	* All SEO Settings page checkboxes are now wrapped in a normalized function for a more seamless integration and if-needed adjustments.
* **Improved:**
	* Hundreds of type optimization checks in if-statements, not only making it more readable, but also two to forty time less taxing on the CPU per optimization (count the Hertz!).
	* Cached the SEO bar translations.
	* render.class.php filters can now return empty string to disable its output.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` consumes less memory.

	* `the_seo_framework_sitemaps_settings_tabs` filter now has an argument parameter.
	* `the_seo_framework_social_settings_tabs` filter now has an argument parameter.
	* `the_seo_framework_add_blogname_to_title` filter now has effect throughout the plugin.
	* `the_seo_framework_canonical_force_scheme` filter now works on all URLs generated by this plugin and has now an `$scheme` argument which passes the current used scheme.
	* WordPress Query detection.
	* Blog page and Home Page query detection.
	* Search query titles aren't escaped twice anymore.
	* Removed duplicated term object calls on term pages, reducing memory usage.
	* When the paged URLs filter is used, the then useless URLs aren't rendered.
	* Plugin settings activation filter usage is now reflected throughout the plugin.
	* When using the plugin settings activation filter, new default options are still applied (which are also filterable).
	* Benchmarks have shown that an array flip to use an isset match only benefits huge arrays very little and only when you're certain the result is at the end of the array. Otherwise, it's a drastic performance decrease. Therefore `$this->is_array()` calls have been set back to the default PHP behavior.
	* `og:image` resizing now doesn't use PCRE anymore, but regular PHP find and replace.
	* `og:image` quality has been upped to 82 from 70. This is according to the [new WordPress 4.5.0 standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/22/proposal-increase-the-default-image-compression-in-wordpress/).
	* This plugin's admin CSS and JS are now registered and cached prior to enqueueing. This speeds things up if multiple script calling hooks are used.
	* The Term SEO box initialization now only happens on the term edit screens.
	* Automated Description Example now uses ID's rather than classes for better JavaScript performance.
	* The protected warned site options are no longer stored in the object. Evidentily removing the `$warned_site_options` object variable and putting it into a function.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::get_warned_settings()` now simply converts the given option values into booleans and then ones and zeros, rather than escaping thoroughly.
	* `AutoDescription_Adminpages::is_default_checked()` now doesn't return `''` anymore when using the echo parameter.
	* `AutoDescription_Adminpages::is_warning_checked()` now doesn't return `''` anymore when using the echo parameter.
	* Disabled the Network options constructor and its class variables, as it's not yet used (and protected).
	* Feed class loader is now only run on feeds to improve performance.
* **Fixed:**
	* `the_seo_framework_dot_version()` now checks for four dot versions if applicable.
	* `AutoDescription_Core::get_the_real_ID()` won't return the latest post ID anymore on taxonomial archives.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Image::get_image()` now returns something when the third parameter is set to false.
	* The SEO Bar column initialization filter used to be called as an action and mixed echoing and returning. It's now a consistent filter, as WP core suggests.
	* Empty delimiter PHP warning when the theme is doing it wrong and no separator has been provided.
	* Improperly sanitized option, disclosed. Although, it holds no security treat as all options always go through multiple sanitation processes.
	* PHP Warning in the robots.txt output. This will make subdirectory sitemaps work again.
	* JavaScript undefined TypeError on mobile screens and Microsoft Edge.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` contained wrong error handling.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` now converts and checks for `$this` correctly. Evidently speeding up the plugin greatly.
	* `The_SEO_Framework_Load::call_function()` now doesn't return a fatal error anymore if class and method isn't found when the class is referred to as string.
	* LD+Json Home Page flushing cache wasn't initialized correctly on SEO settings save.
	* Warned options cache now works.
	* `AutoDescription::title_for_home()` now correctly fetches the front page title option if called outside of the Home Page loop.
* **Deprecated:**
	* `AutoDescription_Detect::current_theme_supports()`, use core `current_theme_supports` instead.
	* Second parameter for `AutoDescription_Generate_Url::the_url()`, use `$args['id']` instead.
	* `AutoDescription_Debug::echo_debug_information()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Debug::get_debug_information()` and refactored.
	* `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::seo_column()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_DoingItRight::seo_bar()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Sitemaps::setup_sitemap_transient()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Sitemaps::setup_sitemap()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Detect::is_locale()` function, replaced by `AutoDescription_Detect::check_wp_locale()` to eliminate naming confusion.
	* `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::get_placeholder_title()` function, use `AutoDescription_Generate_Title::title()` instead with the argument `notagline`.
	* `AutoDescription_Siteoptions::initialize_defaults_admin()` function. Without replacement.
* **Removed:**
	* Open Graph plugins check from Canonical URL output, these are unrelated.
	* Filter/Constant/Action PHP comments indicating changes from 2.3.0 to clean up code.
	* Title generation `placeholder` argument. Use `get_custom_field` and/or `notagline` instead.
	* Leftover `.postbox-container` CSS adjustment.

	* **New:**
		* `the_seo_framework_schema_metabox_before`
		* `the_seo_framework_schema_metabox_after`
* **Notes:**
	* I marked numerous functions with `@access private`. These functions can change behavior at any time without prior notice and should never be used in extension plugins, even though publicly accessible. Please duplicate the function if you really need to use it.
	* Please be aware that all CSS classes will change in a future update, to cover a synonymous namespace for The SEO Framework.
	* At the moment this plugin is hooking into more than 90 actions and filters. WordPress holds the class information when this is done (because of `$this`) and can take up a lot of memory. To resolve this, many class variables will be put into cached functions in an upcoming update.
	* There's an upcoming function for the home title. Currently, the blogname and title are unaptly named. This means that the title is the blogname, and the blogname is the title.
